# Lever-Rule-for-Fe-Fe3C-Phase-Diagram
The code is currently for only predicting what percent of phases are present in a given carbon percent steel. Calculation done using A1 as tie line.
Lever rule is used for the evaluation of the weight / atomic fraction of phases at a particular 
composition using the equilibrium phase diagram. The weight or the atomic fraction of the 
phases depends on the x-axis (abscissa) of the equilibrium phase diagram. The most 
commonly used phase diagram is the Iron – Cementite phase diagram. It could be used for 
the calculation of amount phases in Steel / Cast Iron samples with a particular carbon content. 
Tie line is taken just below the Eutectoid temperature line of 727 Degree Celsius. The 
approximations taken in the app: Eutectoid Composition: 0.8 wt% Carbon, Maximum solubility 
of carbon in Ferrite: 0.025 wt% Carbon, Maximum solubility of carbon in Austenite: 2.14 wt%, 
Cementite: 6.67 wt% C. Amount of phases are displayed as percentage. The proeutectoid 
phases mean the phase that has formed before the transition of the eutectoid temperature. 
Normally in the Iron – Cementite phase diagram till 2.14 wt% carbon it is considered as Steels 
and above 2.14 wt% carbon it is said to be cast iron. Accordingly, the app has been designed 
for determination of the type for the entered carbon content. 

AC3 and ACm are temperature lines in the Iron - Cementite phase diagram. The AC3 
temperature line is for the steel with carbon 0 wt% to 0.8 wt%. At 0.8 wt% C it is Eutectoid 
Steel so it directly converts to Austenite there is no two – phase region. The ACm temperature 
line is for the steel with carbon above 0.8 wt% to 2.14 wt%. Above 2.14 wt% it is Cast Iron. 
The AC3 line is the temperature at which transformation of Ferrite to Austenite is complete 
during heating. ACm line is the temperature at which in hypereutectoid steels the solution of 
Cementite in Austenite is completed during heating. In this app the temperature is determined 
by the mathematical method of congruent triangles. We get the approximate values of the AC3 
and ACm temperature in Degree Celsius. The app is mainly designed for budding Metallurgical 
Engineers for the basic understanding of the Lever rule and Iron cementite phase diagram. 
The two important motives of this app are for 
1. Helping Budding Metallurgical Engineers, 
2. Factory workers/ researchers in the Metallurgy and Materials Engineering Field. 
The app has two calculators one for the calculation of phase amounts and the other as a 
temperature calculator. The app gets only the carbon content of Steel / Cast Iron as input from 
the user and directly the phase amounts are determined. This is according to the Iron – 
Cementite phase diagram which is a widely used phase diagram by the Metallurgical 
Engineers. With respect to this diagram the carbon content is input and then accordingly the 
phases present in the given steel / cast iron is determined along with their percentages. The 
second calculator is for the AC3 and ACm temperature determination for the entered carbon 
content of Steel. These are important temperature lines in the Iron – Cementite Diagram. Lever 
rule is the method used for the phase calculation and simple mathematical method of 
congruent triangles is used for the temperature calculation. This app will surely help the 
budding Metallurgical Engineers to get a proper understanding of these concepts. The app 
has also sample questions and answers for testing the students understanding. There is also 
optical microscopy images of ferrite and pearlite microstructures in the app so that people can 
get an idea of what would be present in their steel. The app also has proper description for 
the performed process. Currently only the final development of a test which users could attend 
and see their level of understanding is being incorporated with this app.

We are attaching the C++ code only then we attach the final app's code from android studio.
